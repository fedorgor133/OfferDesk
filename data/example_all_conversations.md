Conversation 6
Deal Size: Any
Stage: Negotiation
Type: Pricing Objections

## Common Pricing Objections

### "It's too expensive"

**Response Framework:**
1. Acknowledge: "I understand budget is a concern."
2. Reframe: "Let's look at the cost vs value..."
3. Show ROI: "[Metric] improvement pays for itself in [timeframe]"
4. Options: "We have different tiers. Let me show you..."

**Example:**
"I hear you. Our customers typically see [X% improvement] which translates to [$ savings] per month. That's a [Y]x ROI in the first quarter alone."

### "Competitor is cheaper"

**Response:**
"That's a common comparison. The difference is [unique value]. Our customers chose us because:
- [Feature 1] that saves [X hours/week]
- [Support level] vs [competitor's support]
- [Implementation speed] vs [competitor's timeline]

Would you like me to show you a side-by-side comparison?"

### "We need a discount"

**Negotiation Tactics:**

1. **Never discount without getting something:**
   - Annual vs monthly payment: 15% discount
   - Multi-year commitment: 20% discount
   - Case study testimonial: 10% discount
   - Referrals: 5% per referral

2. **Value-add instead of discount:**
   - Free premium support
   - Additional user licenses
   - Implementation services included
   - Quarterly training sessions

3. **Create urgency:**
   "This quarter we have a promotion. If we can close by [date], I can include [value-add]."

### "Not in this year's budget"

**Options:**
1. Start with pilot/trial (smaller commitment)
2. Phase implementation across fiscal years
3. Show cost of NOT solving the problem
4. Payment plans or deferred start date

**Response:**
"I understand. Many clients face this. Let me ask - what's the cost of continuing with your current solution for another year? [Calculate waste/inefficiency]. Sometimes that makes the budget conversation easier."

### Pricing Authority Limits

Know your limits:
- Up to 10%: Approved on the spot
- 10-20%: Manager approval needed (1 day)
- 20%+: VP approval (requires business case)

Never give discount immediately. Always:
1. Explain value first
2. Try value-add approach
3. Ask for commitment if discounting
4. Get it in writing

## General Best Practices

### All Conversations

1. **Listen more than you talk** (60/40 rule)
2. **Understand their why** before presenting solution
3. **Create urgency** without being pushy
4. **Multi-thread** - talk to multiple stakeholders
5. **Document everything** in CRM

### Follow-up Cadence

- Day 0: Send recap email
- Day 2: Check-in call/email
- Day 5: Value-add content
- Day 7: Direct ask for next step
- Day 10: Last attempt, then nurture sequence

### Red Flags to Watch

- "Send me information" (no engagement)
- Ghosting after initial interest
- Can't identify decision maker
- Timeline keeps moving
- Budget "needs approval" indefinitely

When you see red flags: Qualify harder or move to nurture.
